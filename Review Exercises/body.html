        A network bridge is a computer networking device that creates a single, aggregate network from multiple communication networks or network segments. This function is called network bridging.

     <span>
        A switch is a device in a computer network that connects other devices together.
     </span>
    
     <p>
          The main difference between bridge and router is that, bridge study or scan the device’s MAC address.
          <br> On the other hand, router study or scan the device’s IP address.
     </p>
    <span>A switch is a device in a computer network that connects other devices together.</span>
    <br>
    <span>The purpose of switching is to provide interconnection between all the nodes on a network without the need for single connections between each pair of nodes.</span>

    <p>
     <span style="color: cornflowerblue;"> Bridge is a network device </span>, which works in data link layer. <span style="color: cornflowerblue;"> Router is also a network device </span> which works in network layer.

          A switch is a multiport bridge with a buffer and a design that can boost its efficiency(a large number of ports imply less traffic) and performance. <b> A switch is a data link layer device.</b> The switch can perform error checking before forwarding data, which makes it very efficient as <strong> it does not forward packets that have errors</strong> and forward good packets selectively to the correct port only.  In other words, <i> the switch divides the collision domain of hosts </i> , <em> but broadcast domain remains the same. </em>
